				<h2> Values and Priorities </h2>

				<p>
					As a student engineer, the values that I hold close are perseverance, diligence and kindness. Prior to University, I dedicated time engineering a mechatronics mobility aid that increased the manoeuvrability of elderly individuals. As a novice engineer, during the two years of stakeholder engagement, design and prototyping I learned that I must be prepared to dedicate many extra hours in order to succeed in order to overcome unforeseen challenges and build my experience. 

					The value of perseverance resonated throughout my first semester projects in classes such as structures and materials. I was assigned to rigorously design and build a functional bridge. During the build, numerous unexpected problems appeared which required an unrelenting mentality for resolution. 
					In high school, I was a varsity rowing athlete where I learned the incredible importance of teamwork and collaboration with my crew. Our crew would collectively wake up at 5am all 7 days of the week for on water practices. Our early morning practice required each crew member to contribute to the team. A balanced boat that can move smoothly and fluidly is the responsibility of each person in the boat. Teamwork is critical because each person must perform the proper movements and timing to preserve the balance and technique. Throughout the four years, I learned that team chemistry and teamwork is the key to winning races and overall success
					
					My goal and priorities are to ensure that every task I complete is done diligently ensuring that the work is done properly and thoroughly without error. It is also important to me that the solution is accepted by all the stakeholders that are involved.

				<h2> Design Interests and Approach </h2>

				<p>
					My main design goals and interests are usability and manufacturability. From my past experiences, I found passion in both the process of sourcing parts, producing designs as well as user interaction. For example, this includes cost and efficiency analysis of manufacturing methods as well as stakeholder engagement to verify and validate the quality of design.

					Concern for others is another one of my most important interests for design. My most impactful volunteering experience was at a local nature conservation authority. My role as a volunteer was directly linked to protecting the local waterways and wildlife surrounding my community. This was most important to me because of my belief in the sustainability of the planet for future generations.
