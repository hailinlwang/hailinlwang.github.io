				<h2> Structures and Materials (CIV102): Matboard Bridge</h2>

				<p><strong>Introduction</strong>   
				The purpose is to design a bridge which can permit the passage of a 400 N train across a span of 1060 mm and only using Matboard and contact cement to build the strongest bridge possible to be tested under Baldwin Loading. 
				</p>

				<br>
				
				<strong>Concept</strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li> 2 unique cross sections </li>
					<li> 1290mm in length, 100mm width and 20mm height </li>
					<li> Reinforcing bottom flanges to reduce buckling and lower centroidal axis to alleviate shear stresses from loading </li>
					
				</ul>

				<strong> Design features </strong>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
					<li> Safety: Ensuring that professional standards for civil construction are fulfilled </li>
					<li> Manufacturability: Reduced complexity of assembly </li>
					<li> Efficiency: Created features that can be developed quickly </li>
					<li> Stability: Increased supporting flanges and added extra glue </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p> <strong> Discussion </strong> 
				Our predicted failure condition from calculations is that the bridge would fail due to thin plate shear buckling, because among all of our critical values, shear buckling had the smallest number, which is 1752.058112 N. This number is from our calculation of shear buckling for our second section (the last 477 mm of the bridge). Thin plates experience out-of-plane buckling deformations when subjected to critical loads. After testing our bridge failed at approximate 950N. Failure to reach this threshold can be attributed to construction error in addition neglecting stresses arising from deformed geometry which were neglected for the considerations in this project.
